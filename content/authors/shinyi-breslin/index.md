Shinyi was one of my masters students during my PhD.

The goal of this project is to post an embedded os to run on linux, and use the resource control given by cgroups to tightly control how many and how often they may use the resources of the machine. Hence, this will enable better sharing of the resources of the machine, and give a more realistic simulation of the sensor network.
