Craig was one of my final year project students during my PhD. 

The goal of this project is to implement static analysis at compile time to enable safe memory optimisations in message passing languages. Craig was awarded the [Amor Prize](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~pat/4yProjects/HallOfFame/) for outstanding projects. The dissertation can be found [here](./dissertation.pdf)
