title: Evolving Autonomous Networks
abstract: 'This talk outlines the need to an approach to autonomous networks
  which goes beyond the necessary but unscalable "AI + Use Case" approach.
  Instead, this talk advocates for the need to introduce a higher level of
  abstraction at which a self-reflective evolutionary-driven approach can be
  used.  '
