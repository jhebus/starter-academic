title: Autonomous Intent
abstract: >-
  Autonomous networks are seen as a vehicle to address many of the issues
  currently being faced by the telecommunications industry: increasing service
  diversity and demand as well as unprecedented numbers of connected devices.
  But who is driving? 


  Intent-based networking has been proposed as driver, whereby high-level business policy is converted into low-level network actions automatically, however, such a process requires pre-configured mappings and a priori knowledge, limiting the ability for the ‘driver’ to autonomously respond to unknown terrain or drive different types of car. 


  In this talk I will discuss an alternate bottom-up approach, whereby the autonomous network itself can achieve human-specified intent without the need for mappings, as well as different necessary standardisations that will be required to operate such a ‘driver’.
