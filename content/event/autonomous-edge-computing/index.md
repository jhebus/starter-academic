title: Autonomous Edge Computing
abstract: As computing moves from the cloud to the edge, telco operators have
  the opportunity to provide novel and enhanced services to their customers,
  while simultaneously reducing the cost of operation.  The challenges that come
  with edge computing require a new form of interaction between edge-enabled
  applications, the network itself, and the software that controls the platform.
  We address these challenges by creating an ecosystem in which we holistically
  take into consideration how users interact with an edge system; and
  importantly, we are currently engaged in creating the Autonomous operation of
  the platform.
