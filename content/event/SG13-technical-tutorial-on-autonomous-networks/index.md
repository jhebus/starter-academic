This is a technical tutorial on the progress of the ITU-T Focus Group on Autonomous Networks (FGAN) to the parent SG13 group. This talk will cover the efforts of FGAN on capturing the use cases of autonomy, the contributions received from various parties, the architectural contributions, and proposed build-a-thon to tie all this work together.
