This is a work in progress architectural framework for the design of a system capable of performing autonomous operation or networks systems. This is submitted to the [ITU Focus Group on Autonomous Networks](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/an/Pages/default.aspx) as document [FGAN-I-098](https://extranet.itu.int/sites/itu-t/focusgroups/an/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B410264DA-4295-4262-B91D-6060B529C04C%7D&file=FGAN-I-098.docx&action=default).
