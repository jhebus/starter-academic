abstract: This dissertation details the creation of InceOS, a language-specific operating system used to animate Insense, a new component-based language for programming networks of computing devices. A detailed justification for InceOS is made by comparison with other language animation systems, as well as with the existing animation system, explicitly highlighting the inherent flaws and inefficiencies present. The new virtual machine underlying InceOS is presented, with which an Insense application interacts. The design, implementation, and operational considerations of InceOS are also presented. The efficacy of InceOS is quantified through an in-depth performance analysis and comparison with the existing animation environment.
