abstract: The Insense VM is a specialised Java virtual machine for running
  Insense programs on wireless sensor nodes. The VM runs on top of InceOS, a
  purpose-built operating system. A split VM architecture is used, in which
  Insense programs are compiled to Java classes, then linked and compacted on a
  more powerful machine into a form suitable for execution by the VM.
  Measurements demonstrate that the virtual machine achieves good performance
  and memory usage for realistic Insense programs.
