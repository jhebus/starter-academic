abstract = {The combination of improved battery technology and more power-efficient computing hardware has led to the proliferation of heterogeneous distributed systems. This internet of things consists of embedded, wearable, hobbyist, parallel, and commodity devices. Given the different resource and power constraints of such systems, applications must be able to reconfigure or adapt their runtime execution environment in order to make best use of the resources available. In order for the underlying operating system/runtime to support runtime adaptation, an application must be suitably designed. The actor model of computation presents a natural fit for programming such adaptive systems with shared-nothing semantics and use of message passing. This paper addresses the limitations of current actor approaches and argues that an actor is the appropriate unit of adaptation. This is justified through experimentation across heterogeneous platforms.},
