abstract: The combination of improved battery technology and more
  power-efficient computing hardware has led to the proliferation of
  heterogeneous distributed systems. This internet of things consists of
  embedded, wearable, hobbyist, parallel, and commodity devices. Given the
  different resource and power constraints of such systems, applications must be
  able to reconfigure or adapt their runtime execution environment in order to
  make best use of the resources available. In order for the underlying
  operating system/runtime to support runtime adaptation, an application must be
  suitably designed. The actor model of computation presents a natural fit for
  programming such adaptive systems with shared-nothing semantics and use of
  message passing. This paper addresses the limitations of current actor
  approaches and argues that an actor is the appropriate unit of adaptation.
  This is justified through experimentation across heterogeneous platforms.
