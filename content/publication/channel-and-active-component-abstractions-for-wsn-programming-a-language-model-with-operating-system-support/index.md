abstract: To support the programming of Wireless Sensor Networks, a number of
  unconventional programming models have evolved, in particular the event-based
  model. These models are non-intuitive to programmers due to the introduction
  of unnecessary, non-intrinsic complexity. Component-based languages like
  Insense can eliminate much of this unnecessary complexity via the use of
  active components and synchronous channels. However, simply layering an
  Insense implementation over an existing event-based system, like TinyOS, while
  proving efficacy, is insufficiently space and time efficient for production
  use. The design and implementation of a new language-specific OS, InceOS,
  enables both space and time efficient programming of sensor networks using
  component-based languages like Insense.
