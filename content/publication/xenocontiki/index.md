abstract: This report details the modification of Contiki, a wireless sensor network operating system, to allow it to run as a virtual domain over the Xen hypervisor. Also explained is how the simulation was made possible by the use of a central domain to control the messages that are passed between the virtual domains as well as an explanation of the inclusion of the Insense runtime to allow Insense, a component based network language, to take advantage of the simulation environment. This document contains the design and implementation considerations of the XenoContiki project as well documentation of the supporting tools to use the network simulation software.
