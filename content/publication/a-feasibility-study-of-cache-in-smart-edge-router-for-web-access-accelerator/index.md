abstract: Regardless of the setting, edge computing has drawn much attention
  from both the academic and industrial communities. For edge computing, content
  delivery networks are both a concrete and production deployable use case.
  While viable at the WAN or telco edge scale, it is unclear if this extends to
  others, such as in home WiFi routers, as has been assumed by some. In this
  work-in-progress, we present an initial study on the viability of using smart
  edge WiFi routers as a caching location. We describe the simulator we created
  to test this, as well as the analysis of the results obtained. We use 1 day of
  e-commerce web log traffic from a public data set, as well as a sampled subset
  of our own site - part of an ecosystem of over 111 million users. We show that
  in the best case scenario, smart edge routers are inappropriate for e-commerce
  web caching.
