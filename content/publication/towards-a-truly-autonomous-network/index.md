abstract: >
  The communication networks of today can greatly benefit from autonomous
  operation and adaptation, not only due to the implicit cost

  savings, but also because autonomy will enable functionalities that

  are infeasible today. In this paper we motivate the need and present

  our vision for the autonomous future of networking, the concepts and

  technological means to achieve it, and the architecture which emerges

  directly through the application of these concepts. We compare our

  strategy for autonomy with the efforts in academia and industry and

  describe the architecture which we intend to realize within the first

  fully virtualized telecommunication network in existence. We further

  argue that only a holistic architecture based on hybrid learning, functional composition and online experimental evaluation like ours will

  be expressive enough and capable of realizing true autonomy within

  computer networks.
